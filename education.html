                    Here, you will find the academic journey 
                    I have taken across the community colleges and universities I have attended. 
                    Below is a collection of my degrees and certificates earned along the way. 
                    Each credential represents a milestone in my growth, dedication, and commitment to expanding my knowledge. 
                    I have included programs from every institution to provide a complete view of my educational background.
